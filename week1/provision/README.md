if you have multiple server and want to view the server to spin , run `vagrant ssh-config`, this will list all the server

run `vagrant up` to spin the server

run `vagrant ssh Host` to spin a specific host
Certainly! Let's break down the provided instructions:

1. `sudo apt update -y`: This command is used to update the package lists for available software packages on the system. The `-y` flag automatically confirms any prompts that may appear during the update process, allowing it to proceed without requiring manual intervention.

2. **Managing Multiple Servers with Vagrant**:
   - If you have multiple Vagrant-managed servers and want to view their configurations, you can use the `vagrant ssh-config` command. This command lists the SSH configurations for all the servers managed by Vagrant.
3. **Spinning up Servers**:
   - To start all the servers defined in your Vagrantfile, you can use the `vagrant up` command. This command reads the Vagrantfile and starts the virtual machines defined within it.
4. **Connecting to a Specific Host**:
   - If you want to connect to a specific host among the servers managed by Vagrant, you can use the `vagrant ssh Host` command, where `Host` is the name of the host as defined in the Vagrantfile. This command establishes an SSH connection to the specified host, allowing you to access its shell.

These instructions provide a workflow for managing and interacting with multiple virtual servers using Vagrant. They cover updating package lists, viewing server configurations, starting virtual machines, and connecting to specific hosts via SSH.
