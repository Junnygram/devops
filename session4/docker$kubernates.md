#### Docker Overview

**What is Docker?**
- Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

**Provisioning Methods:**
1. **Baremetal:** Takes about 60 minutes.
2. **Cloud Computing:** Takes 2-5 minutes (paid service).
3. **Virtualization:** Uses tools like Oracle VM, VirtualBox (30-45 minutes).
4. **Docker (Containerization):** Quick setup, typically used to run applications efficiently.

**Useful Docker Commands:**
- **docker ps:** Lists all running containers.
- **docker ps -a:** Lists all containers (running + stopped).
- **docker images:** Lists all available images locally.
- **docker run -it centos:7:** Launches an interactive terminal with a CentOS 7 container.
- **docker commit <container_id> <new_image_name>:<version>:** Creates a new image from a running container.
- **docker build -t <image_name>:<version> <path_to_dockerfile>:** Builds a Docker image using a Dockerfile.

**Dockerfile Example:**
```Dockerfile
FROM centos:7
RUN yum install python36 -y
CMD ["python3"]
```
- This Dockerfile creates an image with Python 3.6 installed.

#### Kubernetes Overview

**What is Kubernetes?**
- Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.

**Kubernetes Components:**
1. **Kubernetes Program (K8s):** A manager program responsible for monitoring and maintaining containers.
2. **Pods:** The smallest unit in Kubernetes that manages containers.

**Kubernetes Features:**
- K8s can manage multiple containers across different nodes in a cluster.
- Kubernetes ensures that if a container crashes, it restarts it or creates a new one with the same connectivity.
- Kubernetes is a more mature and reliable container management solution compared to Docker Swarm.

**Minikube:**
- Minikube is a tool that allows you to run Kubernetes locally.
- After setting up Minikube, you can use `kubectl` to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

**Pod Example (pod.yaml):**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
labels:
  app: web
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myc1
    image: mydocker/webserver
```
- This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Pod with a single container running a web server.

**Service Example (service.yaml):**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mylb1
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
  - targetPort: 80
    port: 8080
    nodePort: 30000
```
- This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service that exposes the Pod on a specific NodePort (30000).

**Deployment:**
- Deployments manage the desired state of Pods. Kubernetes will monitor the state of Pods and ensure the desired number of replicas are running at all times.

**Useful Kubernetes Commands:**
- **kubectl get pods:** Lists all Pods running in the cluster.
- **kubectl apply -f <filename.yaml>:** Applies a configuration file (like pod.yaml or service.yaml) to the cluster.

This summary provides a high-level overview of Docker and Kubernetes, covering basic concepts, commands, and YAML configuration examples.
