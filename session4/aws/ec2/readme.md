#### AWS Free Tier Overview

AWS offers a Free Tier that includes 750 hours per month of t2.micro or t3.micro instances for a full year. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **750 Hours Per Month**:
    - This is calculated by multiplying the number of instances by the hours they run.
    - For example:
        - 1 instance running for 24 hours/day for 31 days = 744 hours.
        - 2 instances running for 12 hours/day each for 31 days = 744 hours.
    - If you exceed 750 hours in a month, you will be charged for the extra hours.

#### Instance Hours Calculation

If you spin up multiple instances, their running time accumulates. Here’s an example to clarify:

- **Scenario**:
    - You launch one EC2 instance and let it run for 24 hours.
    - You then launch another EC2 instance and let both run for another 24 hours.

- **Calculation**:
    - First instance: 24 hours.
    - Second instance: 24 hours (for the first 24 hours) + 24 hours (when both are running).
    - Total = 24 + 24 + 24 = 72 hours.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Connecting to an EC2 Instance with VS Code and Managing Instances

#### Connecting to an EC2 Instance with VS Code

1. **Open VS Code:**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code on your local machine.

2. **Install Remote Development Extension Pack:**
   - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - Search for `Remote Development` and install the extension pack.

3. **Connect to the EC2 Instance:**
   - Press `F1` to open the command palette.
   - Type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...` and select it.
   - Enter your EC2 instance's SSH details in the format `ssh -i "path/to/your-key.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip-address>`.

4. **Set Up SSH Configuration (Optional):**
   - Edit your SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config` on Linux/Mac or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\config` on Windows):
     ```plaintext
     Host my-ec2-instance
         HostName <public-ip-address>
         User ec2-user
         IdentityFile path/to/your-key.pem
     ```
   - Now, you can connect using `my-ec2-instance` as the host.

5. **Open Terminal and Folders:**
   - Once connected, you can open a terminal by going to `View` -> `Terminal` or pressing `Ctrl+``.
   - To open a folder, go to `File` -> `Open Folder...` and select the directory you want to work in on the EC2 instance.

#### Transferring Files to EC2 Instance Using SCP

1. **Ensure Your SSH Key is Accessible:**
    - Navigate to the directory containing your SSH key:
      ```bash
      cd ~/Downloads  # Or wherever your key file is located
      ```

2. **Set Appropriate Permissions on the SSH Key:**
    - Ensure your key file has the correct permissions:
      ```bash
      chmod 400 your-key.pem
      ```

3. **Transfer the File Using SCP:**
    - Use the `scp` command to transfer the file. For example, to transfer `fred.txt`:
      ```bash
      scp -i "your-key.pem" fred.txt ec2-user@<public-ip-address>:/home/ec2-user/
      ```
    - If prompted with "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?", type `yes`.

#### Managing EC2 Instances

1. **Starting, Stopping, and Terminating Instances:**
   - Go to the EC2 Dashboard on AWS Management Console.
   - Select the instance you want to manage.
   - Use the `Instance State` dropdown to start, stop, or terminate the instance.

2. **Monitoring Instances:**
   - Use the `Monitoring` tab to view instance metrics.
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for automated monitoring and notifications.

3. **Managing Security Groups:**
   - Go to the `Security Groups` section under the `Network & Security` tab in the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Select the relevant security group.
   - Edit inbound and outbound rules to control traffic.

4. **Attaching and Detaching Volumes:**
   - To manage EBS volumes, go to the `Elastic Block Store` section.
   - Attach or detach volumes as needed to manage storage.

#### Example Script to Automate Instance Setup

1. **User Data Script:**
   - You can use a user data script to automate instance setup when launching an EC2 instance.
   - Example script to install a web server:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     yum update -y
     yum install -y httpd
     systemctl start httpd
     systemctl enable httpd
     echo "<html><h1>Welcome to your web server</h1></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html
     ```

2. **Launch Instance with User Data:**
   - Go to `Launch Instance` in the EC2 Dashboard.
   - In the `Configure Instance Details` section, scroll down to `Advanced Details`.
   - Paste your user data script into the `User Data` field.

#### Connecting to a Windows EC2 Instance

1. **Connecting via RDP:**
   - Open Remote Desktop Connection on your local machine.
   - Enter the public IP address or DNS of your Windows EC2 instance.
   - Use the username `Administrator`.

2. **Decrypting the Password:**
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, select your Windows instance.
   - Click `Actions` -> `Get Windows Password`.
